# Competency - GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions are an API for cause and effect on GitHub: orchestrate any workflow, based on any event, while GitHub manages the execution, provides rich feedback, and secures every step along the way. With GitHub Actions, workflows and steps are just code in a repository, so you can create, share, reuse, and fork your software development practices.

## How do you prove it?
* You can create a continuous integration workflow for a project that automatically runs tests for your code.
* You can create a workflow that produces packages (such as NPM packages) and uploads them to GitHub Packages or another package hosting service.
* You know how to securely store secrets within GitHub, and are aware of the security risks in not doing so.

## How do you improve it?
* Read the [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions)
