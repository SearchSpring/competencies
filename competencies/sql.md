## How do you improve it?

Practice! Start by downloading a database management application such as [Sequel Pro](https://www.sequelpro.com/) for mac or [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) for windows. Of course you can also do everything through the command line! See a list of commonly used commands in this [cheet sheet](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-cheat-sheet.aspx)
